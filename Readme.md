# Overview
WriteNow is a MERN Stack web application that simulates the functionality of Google Docs. 
The application is built using React JS for the frontend and MongoDB with Mongoose for the backend database. 
The application allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time.

# Implementation
- The frontend of the application includes components and styling written in CSS. 
- The backend utilizes Mongoose schemas for the MongoDB database to store user data and document content.

# Features
- The WriteNow web application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, providing users with a familiar interface for creating and editing documents. 
- The application allows for multiple users to collaborate on the same document, with changes being updated in real-time for all users.
- The WriteNow web application is built using modern web technologies and is fully responsive, allowing for easy use on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
